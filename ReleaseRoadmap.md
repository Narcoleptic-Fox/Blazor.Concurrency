## âš¡ Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Fix TypeScript compilation** - Ensure all worker modules compile
2. **Test basic HTTP operations** - Verify C# â†’ JS â†’ C# flow
3. **Mobile storage testing** - Validate fallback mechanisms
4. **Create test project** - Basic Blazor app using services
5. **Document current issues** - Track what needs fixing

**Priority:** Get one complete service (NetworkService) working end-to-end first.
